# Clustering-Techniques-project:

● Worked on a Climate data set containing 18 features and 1763 data points, using different clustering 
models (K-Means, BIRCH, OPTIC) to classify the data into different seasons based on climatic factors.
● Compared the performance of all the clustering algorithms and concluded that OPTIC and another 
density-based clustering won’t be suitable for the dataset while BIRCH and KMeans show good results.
