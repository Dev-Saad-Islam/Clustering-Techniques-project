# Clustering-Techniques-project:

This project focuses on analyzing climate data from Basel, Switzerland spanning the years 2010 to 2019. Pre-processing involved standardizing the data and applying z-score to eliminate outliers. For dimensionality reduction, PCA (Principle Component Analysis) was utilized.

Three clustering techniques (KMeans, BIRCH, OPTICS) were employed to find the optimal number of clusters, supported by the Elbow and Silhouette Methods. Visualization in 3D aided in understanding the clusters generated by each technique.

The project excluded the video stream analysis and primarily centered on the exploration and clustering of climate data, aiming to visualize and understand patterns within the dataset.
